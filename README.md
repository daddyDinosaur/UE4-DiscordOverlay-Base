# Discord Overlay Cheat for Unreal Engine 4 Games
This C++ project is a cheat for Unreal Engine 4 (UE4) games that uses the Discord overlay as a rendering platform. It has a simple UE4 SDK setup that can easily be replaced for any game and allows for creating cheats with ESP and aimbot on the fly. Note that this cheat is mostly undetected if used by one or two people and if precautions are taken, but there are no guarantees.

# How it works
The cheat uses the Discord overlay to render the ESP and aimbot visuals, which are overlaid on top of the game. The cheat leverages a simple UE4 SDK setup that can be easily modified for any UE4 game, and includes offsets to locate player information in memory. The cheat also includes a simple aimbot that tracks the location of enemy players and automatically aims at them.
